The title of this paragraph is time series. Indeed, in hydrology we measure flow not on a continuous basis, but rather at a given frequency. In hydrology, we have been able to make measurements at a high frequency (hourly or smaller), for over 100 years. From this high frequency data, it is possible to obtain a visual representation of the variations of flow. \n",
